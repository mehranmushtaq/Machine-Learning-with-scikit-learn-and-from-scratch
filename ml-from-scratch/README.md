## Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

This project implements core Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using NumPy, without using libraries like Scikit-learn.

The goal of this project is to understand the mathematics and working of ML algorithms internally.


## Algorithms Implemented

## Linear Regression (Gradient Descent)

File: linear_reg.ipynb

Linear Regression models the relationship between input features **X** and target values **y**.

Model Equation:

```
y = wX + b
```

## Features:

✔ Gradient Descent optimization

✔ Bias and weights calculation

✔ Prediction function

✔ Vectorized NumPy operations

## Key Concepts:

	•	Loss minimization
	•	Parameter updates
	•	Convergence
  
## Ordinary Least Squares (OLS Method)

File: linear_reg.ipynb

OLS finds the best-fit line analytically by minimizing squared error.

## Implementation includes:
	Ordinary Least Squares
	Normal Equation solution

OLS Formula:

```
β = (XᵀX)^(-1)Xᵀy
```

## Features:

✔ Analytical solution

✔ No iterations required

✔ Fast computation

✔ Matrix operations

## Key Concepts:
	•	Exact solution
	•	Matrix algebra
	•	No iterations required
