## Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

This project implements core Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using NumPy, without using libraries like Scikit-learn.

The goal of this project is to understand the mathematics and working of ML algorithms internally.


## Algorithms Implemented

1️⃣ Linear Regression (Gradient Descent)

Linear Regression models the relationship between input features **X** and target values **y**.

Model Equation:

```
y = wX + b
```

## Features:

✔ Gradient Descent optimization
✔ Bias and weights calculation
✔ Prediction function
✔ Vectorized NumPy operations
