This project demonstrates how to build a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model using Scikit-learn.

The model is trained on the Iris dataset to classify flower species based on sepal and petal measurements.

The workflow includes:

	•	Data loading
	•	Data visualization
	•	Train–test split
	•	Feature scaling
	•	Model training using KNN
	•	Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
	•	Model evaluation using metrics and confusion matrix
