## 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

This project implements core Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using NumPy, without using libraries like Scikit-learn.

The goal of this project is to understand the mathematics and working of ML algorithms internally.



## Algorithms Implemented

## 1️⃣ Linear Regression (Gradient Descent)

Linear Regression models the relationship between input features **X** and target values **y**.

Model Equation:

```
y = wX + b
```

Features:

✔ Gradient Descent optimization

✔ Bias and weights calculation

✔ Prediction function

✔ Vectorized NumPy operations


## 2️⃣ Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

OLS finds the best-fit line analytically by minimizing squared error.

OLS Formula:

```
β = (XᵀX)^(-1)Xᵀy
```

Features:

✔ Analytical solution

✔ No iterations required

✔ Fast computation

✔ Matrix operations
